#  End-to-End Text Summarizer Project

This is an end-to-end implementation of a **Text Summarizer** using Natural Language Processing techniques and Transformer models. The project is structured in a modular fashion and includes setup for **local execution, Dockerization, and AWS CI/CD deployment using GitHub Actions**.

###  Explanation of Key Files and Folders

####  `config.yaml`
Contains paths for artifacts, model checkpoints, data sources, etc. It enables external configuration of project structure and helps avoid hardcoding file paths.

####  `params.yaml`
Holds parameters for tokenizer, training arguments, model selection (like BART, T5), max lengths, and batch sizes. Makes hyperparameter tuning easy and clean.

####  `src/config/`
Reads and parses values from `config.yaml` and `params.yaml` using classes. These configuration classes ensure clean data flow and modular pipeline creation.

#### `src/components/`
Core logic of the app:
- Data ingestion
- Data transformation
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Model saving/loading

Each task is modularized into separate files.

####  `src/pipeline/`
Orchestrates the pipeline for training and prediction by calling appropriate components and passing configurations. It decouples business logic from orchestration.

####  `app.py`
This is the frontend of the project using Flask. It exposes a route (`/predict`) where the user can input long text and get the summarized output in real-time.

####  `main.py`
The main execution script that triggers the entire training pipeline, coordinating everything from data ingestion to model training.

####  `.github/workflows/main.yaml`
GitHub Actions CI/CD setup:
- Builds a Docker image on every `main` branch push
- Pushes it to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- Pulls it onto EC2 for live deployment

## AWS-CICD-Deployment-with-Github-Actions

### Login to AWS console.

1. Create an **IAM User** with:
   - `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess`
   - `AmazonEC2FullAccess`

2. Create an **ECR repository**  
   Example URI:  
   `866923973375.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/text-s`

3. Launch an **EC2 instance (Ubuntu)**

4. Install Docker in EC2:

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
newgrp docker
```

5. Set up the EC2 instance as a **self-hosted GitHub Runner** via:
```
GitHub > Settings > Actions > Runners > self-hosted 
```

### GitHub Secrets Configuration

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION`
- `AWS_ECR_LOGIN_URI`
- `ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME`

---

##  GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yaml`)

This file automates:
- Docker image build
- Login to ECR
- Push image to ECR

It allows seamless deployment whenever new code is pushed to `main`.
